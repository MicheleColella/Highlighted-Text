# Karaoke-Text-effect
This Swift script utilizes SwiftUI to create a karaoke effect on a provided text. The text is progressively displayed, with each character lighting up as it's being read. Leveraging SwiftUI's native animations, the text scrolls at an adjustable speed, simulating the karaoke effect. It's a simple yet effective implementation showcasing how to create custom animation effects in SwiftUI.
